Today's exercise: Ebool

Repo: boolean-uk-react-ebool

Description
Today we're practising building routes in a React app, by creating your little version of an eCommerce app! It will also put you to the test, as you'll have to use everything you've learned so far!

Instructions
- ✅Use this starting template => https://codesandbox.io/s/react-routes-ebool-sarter-template-v2otu
- ✅Start your json-server with json-server --watch db/db.json -p 4000
- ✅The templates folder has a template for each page you have to build
- ✅There's a folder with screenshots of each page you have to build
- ⚠The app should have 3 main routes: products, categories, basket
- ✅When a user lands on the app, it should be redirected to the products route
- Make sure you have dynamic routes for the products detail page once a user clicks on a product card
- ⚠Inside the Categories, each category should lead to a filtered version of the products page
- The add to basket button on the Products Details page shout add the item to the basket, and take you to the basket page 

Tips
- With routes, your URL bar becomes part of your state! Use it to your advantage, by setting up your routes with dynamic parameters

Challenge
- ✅⚠Create a "404 not found" page that should appear every time that a route doesn't match
- ⚠Implement a search bar that on submits should take you to a products page with the results of the search
